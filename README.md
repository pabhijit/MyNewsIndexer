newsindexer
===========

This is my implementation for CSE 535 Fall 2014 Project 1 & 2.
This project aims to build a News indexer with the following goals:
•	Parse simple news articles with minimal markup
•	Index a decent sized subset of the given news corpus.
•	Create multiple indexes on the news articles as well as metadata.
•	Provide an index introspection mechanism that can later be built upon to support queries.
